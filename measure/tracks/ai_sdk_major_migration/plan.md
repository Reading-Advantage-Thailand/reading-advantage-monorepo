# Plan: AI SDK Major Migration

## Phase 1: Contract & Schema Definition

- [x] Task: Audit current `@ai-sdk/*` versions and identify breaking changes. (`43c31318`)
  - Red file: `packages/ai/src/__tests__/phase-11-sdk-version-contract.test.ts`
    (Task 1 `describe`: manifest-major pins on root + `packages/ai` + 4 affected
    app manifests; lockfile single-major pins on `ai` / `@ai-sdk/openai` /
    `@ai-sdk/google`).
- [x] Task: Map all AI adapter call sites in `packages/domain/src/ai/`. (`43c31318`)
  - Red file: same `phase-11-sdk-version-contract.test.ts` (Task 2 `describe`:
    `get-recommendation.ts` keeps DI shape — no direct `@ai-sdk/*` import;
    the `packages/ai/src/__tests__/contract-suite.ts` chokepoint remains the
    provider surface).
- [x] Task: Define version-alignment contracts for the new major. (`43c31318`)
  - Red file: same `phase-11-sdk-version-contract.test.ts` (Task 3 `describe`:
    "no v1 holdout in any manifest" + "no v1 entry in `pnpm-lock.yaml`" + the
    single `target major` constant that the rest of the track will read).
  - Owner note: see `measure/tracks/ai_sdk_major_migration/test-strategy.md` §5
    (P1) and §6 (P1 targeted Red command) for the exact file location and the
    bounded vitest invocation the MID role commits to.

### Red-gate record (MID role)

- Targeted Red command:
  `pnpm --filter @reading-advantage/ai exec vitest run src/__tests__/phase-11-sdk-version-contract.test.ts`
  (per test-strategy §6 P1 row).
- Targeted Red result at HEAD: **10 failed | 8 passed (18 total)**.
  Failures are exactly the contract gaps Phase 3 must close:
  - **Task 1 (4 failed `it` blocks)** — manifest `ai` range is still on the
    legacy `^4.x` major in `packages/reading-advantage-scripts`
    (`^4.0.22`), `apps/reading-advantage` (`^4.0.22`),
    `apps/primary-advantage` (`^4.3.9`), `apps/codecamp-advantage`
    (`^4.3.9`). Each is asserted to require `^5.x`.
  - **Task 2 (0 failed `it` blocks)** — the DI shape in
    `packages/domain/src/ai/get-recommendation.ts` is intact today; the
    `deps.generateRecommendation` contract and the no-`@ai-sdk/*`-import
    rule both hold. The Task 2 `it` blocks pass and act as a regression
    net during P3.
  - **Task 3 (6 failed `it` blocks)** — `pnpm-lock.yaml` resolves
    **both** legacy and target majors for every `@ai-sdk/*` package:
    `ai` → `{4, 5}`, `@ai-sdk/openai` → `{1, 2}`, `@ai-sdk/google` →
    `{1, 2}`. The two assertions per package (single-major + no-legacy)
    both fire, producing the 6 failures.
  - Root manifest + `packages/ai` + DI-shape + zod-single-major: **all
    pass at HEAD** (regression nets; they protect against drift, not
    against missing implementation).
- RED fail count and per-test reasons are also recorded in the commit
  body of the Red-phase test commit.

### Green-gate record (JR role)

- Targeted Green command:
  `pnpm --filter @reading-advantage/ai exec vitest run src/__tests__/phase-11-sdk-version-contract.test.ts`
- Targeted Green result: **18 passed (18 total)**.
- Green changes:
  - Bumped `ai` from `^4.x` to `^5.0.95` in 4 manifests:
    `packages/reading-advantage-scripts`, `apps/reading-advantage`,
    `apps/primary-advantage`, `apps/codecamp-advantage`.
  - Bumped `@ai-sdk/openai` from `^1.x` to `^2.0.68` in same 4 manifests.
  - Bumped `@ai-sdk/google` from `^1.x` to `^2.0.36` in 3 manifests:
    `apps/reading-advantage`, `apps/primary-advantage`,
    `apps/codecamp-advantage`.
  - Bumped `@ai-sdk/google-vertex` from `^2.x` to `^3.0.142` in 3 manifests:
    `packages/reading-advantage-scripts`, `apps/reading-advantage`,
    `apps/primary-advantage`. Required because `@ai-sdk/google-vertex@2.x`
    has a hard dependency on `@ai-sdk/google@1.x`, which caused the
    lockfile to resolve both v1 and v2 of `@ai-sdk/google`.
  - Regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml` via `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`.
- Broader gate: `pnpm turbo run test` — all packages pass; the
  `@reading-advantage/db` ESM smoke test has a timing-related flake
  (passes in isolation, fails under turbo load with 10s timeout). All
  `@reading-advantage/ai` tests pass (137 passed, 3 skipped).
- Green commit: `43c31318`

### Adversarial audit record

- Finding: Phase 1 contract coverage only pinned `@ai-sdk/openai`,
  `@ai-sdk/google`, and `ai`; it missed direct `@ai-sdk/*` manifest
  holdouts such as `@ai-sdk/react ^1.2.9` in `apps/primary-advantage`
  and `apps/codecamp-advantage`.
- Tight fix: `phase-11-sdk-version-contract.test.ts` now requires every
  direct `@ai-sdk/*` dependency in affected manifests to have an explicit
  target-major contract, and the lockfile guard now checks those package
  names too.
- Downstream coverage: the strengthened contract intentionally exposes
  `@ai-sdk/react` v1 in two app manifests and related legacy lockfile
  entries so the owning implementation phases cannot silently miss them.
- Verification note: local shell for this adversarial attempt did not have
  `node`, `npm`, or `pnpm` on `PATH`; supervisor gate logs for attempts 1
  and 2 show `npm test` exited 0.

## Phase 2: Test

- [~] Task: Add contract tests for the AI adapter layer against the new API.
  - Red file: `packages/ai/src/__tests__/phase-11-sdk-v2-call-shape.test.ts`
    (Task 1 `describe`: runs `runAIClientContract` against each
    provider; snapshots captured mock call args; asserts v2 call
    shape — `maxOutputTokens` (v5) instead of `maxTokens` (v1),
    canonical `generateImage` import path, no `maxTokens` reaching
    the SDK).
  - Red file extensions: v2-shape assertions appended to
    `packages/ai/src/__tests__/phase-3-openai-provider.test.ts`,
    `packages/ai/src/__tests__/phase-4-google-provider.test.ts`, and
    `packages/ai/src/providers/openrouter.test.ts` (each provider
    gets a per-provider `describe` block pinning its v5 call shape
    on the `vi.mock`'d SDK).
  - `phase-arch-no-direct-sdk.test.ts` is **not** owned by this
    task — per `test-strategy.md` §7, it is intentionally Red until
    *all* P3 app tasks land and is owned by the final P3 task
    ("Migrate `apps/codecamp-advantage` chat route to adapter").
    Created when that `[~]` task starts, not here.
  - Owner note: see `measure/tracks/ai_sdk_major_migration/test-strategy.md` §5
    (P2) and §6 (P2 targeted Red command) for the exact file locations
    and the bounded vitest invocation the MID role commits to.
- [~] Task: Confirm tests fail against the current (pre-migration) baseline.

### Red-gate record (MID role)

- Targeted Red command (test-strategy §6 P2):
  `pnpm --filter @reading-advantage/ai exec vitest run src/__tests__/phase-11-sdk-v2-call-shape.test.ts src/__tests__/phase-arch-no-direct-sdk.test.ts src/providers/openai.test.ts src/providers/google.test.ts src/providers/openrouter.test.ts`
- Targeted Red result at HEAD: **10 failed | 16 passed (26 total)**.
  - `phase-11-sdk-v2-call-shape.test.ts`: 8 failed — 6
    `maxTokens → maxOutputTokens` (cross-provider loop, two per
    provider × 3 providers) + 2 `generateImage canonical v5
    export` (OpenAI, Google). OpenRouter excluded from the image
    contract because its `generateImage` throws `AIClientError`
    (no image support); its image-shape contract lives in
    `providers/openrouter.test.ts`.
  - `providers/openrouter.test.ts`: 2 failed — `generateText` and
    `generateObject` still spread `maxTokens` (v1) into the v5 SDK
    call instead of `maxOutputTokens`.
  - `providers/openai.test.ts` / `providers/google.test.ts`: all
    pass (in-source provider tests were not extended in this
    phase — extensions live in the matching `phase-3-*` /
    `phase-4-*` files per test-strategy §5 P2).
- Extended Red surface (per-provider v2-shape extensions per
  test-strategy §5 P2 "extend `phase-3-*` and `phase-4-*`"):
  - `phase-3-openai-provider.test.ts`: 2 failed — `generateText`
    / `generateObject` v2-shape.
  - `phase-4-google-provider.test.ts`: 2 failed — `generateText`
    / `generateObject` v2-shape.
  - Combined extended run (targeted + phase-3/4 extensions):
    **14 failed | 45 passed | 2 skipped (61 total)**.
- All failures are exactly the contract gaps Phase 3 must close:
  the v1 keyword `maxTokens` leaks into v5 SDK calls and is
  silently dropped, so token caps do not apply. Phase 3 must
  rename the kwarg to `maxOutputTokens` (v5 keyword) and switch
  the image import from the v1 alias `experimental_generateImage`
  to the canonical v5 `generateImage`.
- RED fail count and per-test reasons are also recorded in the
  commit body of the Red-phase test commit.
- `phase-arch-no-direct-sdk.test.ts` is **not** in the run because
  it is intentionally Red until *all* P3 app tasks land and is
  owned by the final P3 task (test-strategy §7); it does not
  exist on disk yet and the targeted command picks it up
  gracefully when the owning task lands.

## Phase 3: Implement

- [ ] Task: Upgrade `@ai-sdk/*` packages in root and workspace manifests.
- [ ] Task: Update the internal AI adapter for breaking API changes.
- [ ] Task: Run `check-types`, `lint`, and `test` across affected workspaces.

## Phase 4: Validate & Close

- [ ] Task: Run full `pnpm turbo run lint|test|check-types|build` aggregate gate.
- [ ] Task: Re-run `pnpm outdated` and `pnpm audit`; document results.
- [ ] Task: Update `measure/tech-stack.md` with the selected AI SDK version.
